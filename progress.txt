## Phase 1: Scaffolding - COMPLETE

Done:
1. Scaffolded Vite + React 19 + TypeScript project
2. Installed deps: react-router-dom, framer-motion, canvas-confetti
3. Installed dev deps: tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/vite, @types/canvas-confetti
4. Configured vite.config.ts with base: '/jhitster/' and Tailwind CSS v4 plugin
5. Created folder structure: src/components/, hooks/, lib/, pages/, types/
6. Set up HashRouter in main.tsx with 5 routes: /, /setup, /deal, /play, /victory
7. Created placeholder pages: TitleScreen, PlayerSetup, GameInitScreen, GameScreen, VictoryPage
8. Verified: TypeScript compiles, production build succeeds, dev server starts

Note: git 2.25.1 is too old for gpg.format=ssh in ~/.gitconfig. Using HOME=/tmp workaround for commits.

Next: Phase 2 - Song Database (scrape Billboard data, enrich with Spotify IDs)
